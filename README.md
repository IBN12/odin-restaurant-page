The Odin Project: Restaurant Page Project

## Project Description:
The restaurant project includes 5 modules in the navigation header that the user can view through the main content display section. The Home module is the default module set
to be viewed when the application opens up, it gives an introduction about the application. The menu, drinks, about us, and contact us modules are 
supplemental with similar material that you would see on most restaurant pages on the net.
